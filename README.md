# VirtualTourist

4th Project in Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree.

This app allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for this locations.

1. [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation)
2. [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit)
3. [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit)
4. [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) to store images.


## To Build and Run:
